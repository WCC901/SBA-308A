Overview

Tavern Sim is an application that is supposed to let the user press the recruit button and randomly select three characters (pulled from the DnD API) represented by pictures. From there the user would be able to click on one of the pictures to add that character to their team or press the recruit button again to bring in new characters for the user to select from.
